# About Website Template

Each system will have a [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)/[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) website to track contributions, phases, and documentation. This repo is a template for the system about websites. 

This template is build using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) website uses the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme. Creating and editing these websites will not require any knowledge of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). But if interested, the setup instrucitons are available in the [github-pages-deply-jekyll repo](https://github.com/codeadamca/github-pages-deploy-jekyll).
